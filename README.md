# nodejs-coding-problem
This coding task is designed to evaluate how you approach creative problem-solving in writing a simple algorithm using NodeJS. The task is based on a real-world scenario in which we are scraping data from an API hosted on premises with the need to throttle requests, for example to ensure availability is maintained for other users during normal business hours.

## Introduction
This coding task is designed to evaluate how you approach creative problem-solving in writing a simple
algorithm using NodeJS. The task is based on a real-world scenario in which we are scraping data from
an API hosted on premises with the need to throttle requests, for example to ensure availability is
maintained for other users during normal business hours.

## Time
A senior developer typically solves this problem in 30-60 minutes, and it should not take more than 2
hours in total.

## Requirements
Write a NodeJS function that solves the problem to the best of your ability. Along with your code, please
provide 1-2 paragraphs of text explaining why you chose this approach, and what other methods you
considered and rejected. Note that no external libraries/dependencies are allowed at all.

You can use StackOverflow etc. but be aware we are aware of all similar solutions and many do not fulfill
all of the requirements.
